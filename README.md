Project Name: Analysis of Water Quality and Potability to Develop a Prediction System to Predict the Water Quality and Potability
Team member: Cheng Yu Wu, Zining Lyu

Our project aims to utilize data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict the potability of water based on various quality 
indicators (e.g. PH, Solids, etc.) and provide valuable insights about the key drivers in determining water potability (1: potable; 0: not potable).
By exploring, cleaning, transforming, and evaluating the models (logistic regression, random forest, optimized random forest, XGBoost, optimized
XGBoost), we found that optimized XGBoost tend to have a higher recall value and optimized Random Forest tend to have higher values in accuracy and
AUC. Moreover, by evaluating the models, we found variables pH, sulfate, Hardness, solids, and chloramines are top 10 variables in determining water
quality and potability.

To run the code, firstly please import and dataset to the jupyter notebook and then follow the code to see the outcomes. By following the codes,
most important variables and their feature importance could be viewed directly.
