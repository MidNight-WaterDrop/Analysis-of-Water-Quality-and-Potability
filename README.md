# Water Quality and Potability Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive analytics system for classifying water as potable or non-potable using machine learning models. By analyzing various water quality parameters, the system enhances decision-making in water quality monitoring and public health.

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Imbalanced Data** – Applied **resampling techniques** to balance classes.
2. **Feature Selection** – Used **Random Forest, XGBoost, and LASSO** for key variable identification.
3. **Scalability** – Implemented **MySQL for data storage** and optimized processing with Python.

## Key Findings
- **pH, Sulfate, Hardness, and Solids** were the most influential variables.
- **Random Forest & XGBoost** outperformed traditional models.
- **Hyperparameter tuning improved prediction accuracy**, boosting recall and precision.

## Future Work
- **Expand data sources** for better generalization.
- **Implement real-time monitoring** capabilities.
- **Improve interpretability** with explainable AI techniques.
